This repo is the backend to my Soccer App that allows players to sign up for pickup games or schedule their own within the Chicago community. This backend was built with Ruby, Rails, Postgres, and SQL, using Insomnia and Postico for manual testing and to verify that the data executes the expected behavior. In order to run this on your system, you can clone it to a folder in your terminal and run the command `rails serve` in for the program to start. Once you do, open your browser and type in `localhost:3000/api/games` in order to see all of the games on the backend given the starter data set.
